LEARN AND DESIGN:	These are things that need thought.

Create "Shadow Lines"
Create sensors(triggers), how to filter what triggers?
Implement the IO system
Rule Of The Big Three APPLIED
Inheritance Design needs more thought, particularly with chunks and modules.
Where is input handled?
Smart Pointers, should we be using Boost?
Is it ok that we are using vectors of pointers?
Code Profiler
Enable Debug Compile Mode
Text input boxes/more GUI, maybe another library?
Decouple Code More?



TODO:	These are things that need to be done and don't require much thought.

Write = operator and constructor to switch between sf::Vector and b2Vec2.
Write Shadow Lines class



CLEAN UP:	These are things that we should do sometime and periodically

Search for new and deletes to make sure things are getting cleaned up.
Standardize the units we are using for tile size, ideally 1x1 typedef a new unit and make a function to convert it from and to its sfml and box2d types
Replace numbers with variables.
Review file structure.
Review all variable and class names.
Push more stuff out of game.cpp.
Learn to use CONST and STATIC better
How can we clean up our include heirarchy?
