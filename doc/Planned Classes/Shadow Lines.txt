To cast shadows, no object will do it by default, instead, we want to create a point entity that can be linked
to another point entity of the same type, thus creating a line. Using raycasting, we can cast shadows from this. To create a wall. You would have
the wall tiles all in a line, then you would put a point at one end of the wall, behind it, and another at the other 
end, also behind it. That way, the shadow would be cast behind the wall, so you could still see the wall.
