	Common:
Enable	(none)
Disable	(none)
Die	(none)

Set(Function) (modifier, +, -, *, /, = num)


=======================================================================================TRIGGERS
	Triggers are sensors that do various things:
Enable: will operate normally
Disable: wont search for things triggering
Die: destroys this

INPUTS:
SetFilter: will use the filter to get objects
OUTPUTS:
OnTrigger
OnUntrigger
OnCount num



///Trigger_Base{sets up generic trigger like functions and variables}
Trigger_Push {an entity that exerts a force on chunks in itself}
Trigger_Control {switches control from the entity that entered it to the chunk it is a part of, can also restore control}
Trigger_Teleport {teleports the chunk to the target point}


=======================================================================================CHUNKS
	Chunks are the bodies basically, they can be as large as you want, 
	and can be created in seperate files, and loaded into the
	editor, or created then and there. They can have a controller
Enable: will take control
Disable: won't accept control inputs
Die: destroys this

INPUTS:
Sleep: invisible and doesnt do anything (offworld)
Wake: goes to normal
AddEnergy: {adds the amount of energy to our reserves}
SendSubMessage: {as the parameter, dictate another message to be sent to our modules}
OUTPUTS:
OnEnergy num
OnSpeed num

///Chunk_Base
Chunk_Ship {}
Chunk_Station {static chunk}
Chunk_Actor {}
Chunk_Debris {}
Chunk_Bullet {collision with non sensor is set to do damage and die}
Chunk_Wall {rectangular wall, can be visible or invisible}
Chunk_Item {on contact with Creature, tries to add its data to the body}

=======================================================================================MODULES
	Modules are things that go on a ship, dictates health, textures, and other attributes
Enable: operates normally and sets itself to standard form
Disable: is destroyed, doesn't function, could be repaired
Die: destroys this

INPUTS:
Activate: does something, like shoot, turn shield on, open, ect
SetHealth: sets our current health to the
SetArmor: set our armor
Damage: applies damage with standard calculations
OUTPUTS:
OnHealth num


///Module_Base {health, the ability to be destroyed, activate function}
Module_Shield {creates a Trigger_Push that is radialy outward}
Module_Capacitor {Adds to the max electrical capacity of the Chunk)}
Module_Radar {increases maximum zoom level}
Module_Turret {Holds one gun, and limited amounts of each ammo type}
Module_Door {activate toggles openness, also activated by touch}
Module_Floor {allows players and bullets to pass through them to allow movement}
Module_Container {holds any item}


=======================================================================================IO
	IO is for managing the IO system
Enable: will accept activate command
Disable: wont accept activate command
Die: destroys this

INPUTS:
Activate: sends outputs
OUTPUTS:
OnActivated

IO_Filter {filters based on type selected}
IO_Relay {just a container for complex IO systems}
IO_Timer {container for timed outputs}
IO_Sound {plays a sound at the given volume and position on activate}
IO_Count {keeps count of a number, additional: OnCount num, SetCount

=======================================================================================POINT
Enable: normal
Disable: is destroyed, doesn't function
Die: destroys this

Point_Target {just a coordinate for other people to use}
Point_ShadowController {governs over various start end points}
Point_ShadowStart {two points are used to form shadows}
Point_ShadowEnd {start links to end to form simple 4 sided polygon to shade in}



Sub Typed:
Trigger_Push (Radial, Linear): Radial can dictate distance modifier, linear dictates direction
